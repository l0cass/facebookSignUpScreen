# React Native Form Validation App

This repository contains a React Native application that demonstrates form validation using the `yup` library along with `react-hook-form` for managing form state. The app allows users to sign up by providing their telephone number, email, and password. It features:

- **Form Validation:** Input fields for telephone, email, and password are validated using Yup schemas. Error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.
- **Masked Input:** The telephone input field utilizes a masked text input component to format the phone number as per a specific pattern.
- **Styling:** The app is styled using React Native's StyleSheet, featuring a clean and responsive design.
- **Image Assets:** Includes an image asset for the header.

**Technologies Used:**

- React Native
- Yup (for schema validation)
- react-hook-form
- react-native-mask-text (for masked input)

**How to Run:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.

Feel free to contribute or use this project as a reference for implementing form validation in your React Native applications.
